## 🎯 Key Concepts

### Design Strategy
- **Three LLaMa Moon**: Branding/intro screen, establishes mystical AI energy
- **AI Llama**: Interactive character for creative coding, inspiration, complex concepts
- **TeacherBot-77**: Retro robot for technical subjects, debugging, systematic analysis
- **Physical Avatars**: Vinyl versions for cognitive apprenticeship and classroom presence
- **Phased Development**: PNGtuber → Live2D → Production (validate fast, upgrade later)

### Technical Stack
- **Rendering**: Melba-Toaster (Godot + Live2D Cubism SDK)
- **AI Backend**: OpenAI → Local Llama progression
- **Integration**: WebSocket API for real-time communication
- **Deployment**: Docker containers, OBS-ready output

### Timeline (Phased Approach)
- **Week 1**: PNGtuber foundation - validate AI integration with simple image swapping
- **Week 2**: Enhanced PNGtuber - full educational features and voice integration
- **Week 3**: Live2D conversion - upgrade to smooth animation while preserving functionality  
- **Week 4**: Production polish - deployment, monitoring, and classroom testing

## ⚡ Immediate Actions

### This Week (PNGtuber Phase)
```bash
# 1. Create character expression assets
# - Extract llama base from Three LLaMa Moon SVG
# - Create 7 expressions: neutral, happy, thinking, explaining, excited, confused, talking
# - Create 7 TeacherBot-77 expressions with retro computer aesthetic

# 2. Set up simple rendering environment  
pip install pygame asyncio websockets openai
# Build basic PNGtuber engine with image swapping

# 3. Test AI integration
# - OpenAI API for response generation
# - Character selection logic (creative → llama, technical → TeacherBot-77)
# - Expression mapping based on response content
```

### Key Decisions Made
- ✅ **Framework**: NOM-Network Melba-Toaster (proven, production-ready)
- ✅ **AI Strategy**: Hybrid cloud/local (fast development, future-proof)
- ✅ **Scope**: Educational assistant (your expertise area)
- ✅ **Timeline**: 3-week sprint (agile methodology)

# Create assets/ directory structure
mkdir -p assets/characters/{llama,teacherbot}

# 2. Review PNGtuber Implementation Guide (5 min)
# Understand Week 1 detailed plan and technical requirements

# 3. Set up development environment (5 min)
pip install pygame openai asyncio websockets
# Install image editing software (GIMP/Photoshop/Figma)

# 4. Plan Week 1 sprint
# - Day 1-2: Create 14 character expression PNGs
# - Day 3-4: Build basic PNGtuber renderer 
# - Day 5-7: AI integration and testing
```

### This Week's Goal
**Friday Demo Target**: 
- **Question**: "How do I fix this Python syntax error?"
- **System Response**: TeacherBot-77 appears with analyzing expression, provides technical debugging help
- **Question**: "Explain how recursion works conceptually"  
- **System Response**: Llama appears with thinking → explaining expressions, provides inspirational explanation

**Success = Validation**: When both characters respond appropriately to their specialty areas with correct expressions, you've proven the entire educational AI concept and de-risked the Live2D investment.
